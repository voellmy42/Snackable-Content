Here are 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about Starship Mars Mission as of 2024:

• **Mission Overview**: The Starship Mars Mission is a NASA-led mission to send the first humans to Mars in the mid-2030s. The mission aims to establish a sustainable human presence on the Red Planet, with the goal of sending the first woman and the next man to Mars.

• **Starship Spacecraft**: The Starship spacecraft is a reusable vehicle designed by SpaceX for the mission. It will be powered by a Raptor engine and will have the capacity to carry both people and cargo to Mars. The spacecraft will also serve as a lunar taxi, taking astronauts from Earth's orbit to the Moon's surface.

• **Mission Timeline**: NASA plans to send its first crewed mission to Mars in 2035, with subsequent missions scheduled for every two years. The first crew will consist of four people: two astronauts and two mission specialists.

• **Destination**: The Starship spacecraft will travel over 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to reach Mars, which is expected to take around six months. Upon arrival, the spacecraft will enter into a low-orbit orbit around the Red Planet.

• **Mars Lander**: A separate spacecraft called the Mars Lander will be used to transport astronauts from the Starship spacecraft to the Martian surface. The Mars Lander will be powered by a smaller version of the Raptor engine and will have a descent module to slow down its entry into the Martian atmosphere.

• **Life Support System**: The Starship spacecraft has been designed with a life support system capable of sustaining four people for up to 26 months, depending on their individual needs. This includes air, water, food, and waste management systems.

• **Radiation Protection**: To protect astronauts from harmful radiation during the long-duration journey to Mars, NASA is developing specialized protective garments called "space suits" that will provide adequate shielding against cosmic rays.

• **Robotics and Artificial Intelligence**: The Starship spacecraft will be equipped with advanced robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) systems to assist in navigation, communication, and scientific research on the Martian surface.

• **Scientific Payloads**: In addition to carrying astronauts, the Starship spacecraft will also carry a range of scientific payloads designed to study the Martian atmosphere, geology, and potential biosignatures. This includes instruments such as spectrometers, cameras, and seismometers.

• **Partnerships and Collaboration**: NASA is working closely with SpaceX, private industry partners, and international space agencies to advance the development of Starship technology and ensure its success in sending humans to Mars.
